//  Creating Variables and Functions

// - movieDataUrl simply has a string with the url of the json file with our data
// - movieData will store the data we import as a javascript object
// - canvas is a d3 selection of the svg canvas by its id
// - drawTreeMap is a function to create the treemap once we have imported our data

let movieDataUrl = 'https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/tree_map/movie-data.json'

let movieData

let canvas = d3.select('#canvas')

let drawTreeMap = () => {

    
// #3: My tree map should have rect elements with a corresponding class="tile" that represent the data
// Creating a Hierarchy:
// - We first have to create a 'hierarchy' with our data to tell d3 how to order things and how to determine the areas of items
// - We do this by calling the d3.hierarchy() method. We give this two arguments. 
// Firstly, the data object movieData which we imported earlier, 
// secondly a function to point it to where the child nodes are â†’ 
// here they are in an array called 'children' so we return that
// - We then call the sum() method on this hierarchy, where we give it a function that takes in one of the items/nodes of the tree, 
// in this case, a movie and tell it from where we should determine the area. We want this to be based on the value, since a larger value should create a larger block. 
// So point this to return the 'value' field.
// - We then call the sort() method on this hierarchy to specify how we should order the data.
//  This is given a function that takes in any two nodes. We subtract and return the value of node 1 from node 2.
//  If this is positive, node 2 has a higher value and should be ahead, otherwise node 1 should be ahead

let hierarchy = d3.hierarchy(movieData, 
    (node) => {
        return node['children']
    }
).sum(
    (node) => {
        return node['value']
    }
).sort(
    (node1, node2) => {
        return node2['value'] - node1['value']
    } 
)

}


// Fetching the Data
// - Call the d3 json() method, giving the url of the json data
// - Specify a function to run in .then() when the promise is resolved, that takes in the data
//  (d3 has converted from json to javascript object) and any errors
// - If there is an error, log it, otherwise set the movieData variable to the data
// - Finally, run the drawTreeMap() method to use the data to draw the treemap

d3.json(movieDataUrl).then(
    (data, error) => {
        if(error){
            console.log(error)
        } else {
            movieData = data
            console.log(movieData)
            drawTreeMap()
        }
    }
)
